            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Thirdly, the reaſon brought in, in the 10: verſe. for to prove theſe propheſied falſely, and that they did deceive the people: for thus ſaith the Lord (whatever your Dreamers ſay) after 70. yeares be accompliſht in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, I will viſit you and perform, my good word towards you: he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152491:11"/>ſaies not after two yeares, but after 70. wherein the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes thus much, that their falſe prophets knew not his mind, ſpoke not his will, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his Meſſage, but all was from their owne hearts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Ier. 25.30.</note> becauſe <hi>Ieremiah</hi> muſt be reproved, ſtockt, and impriſoned for ſending ſuch a meſſage to them in Babylon, this is <hi>Shemajabs</hi> will, and the reſt in captivitie, ſent in writing to the people and prieſts at Ieruſalem, eſpecially to <hi>Zephaniah</hi> the prieſt.

            <p>In this verſe the Lord brings proofe of what he had ſpoken before, concerning his recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſrael out of Captivitie at the 70. yeares end: wherein we may ſee the Lord guiding of his Saints even to know the great deep of his own purpoſe, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their comming out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon: his purpoſe indeed was revealed in his promiſe, made in the former verſe, but this will not ſuffice the Lord to ſay, I will viſit you, I will cauſe you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152491:17"/>to this place; but he will give in ground for it: for I know the thoughts that I think to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, &amp;c. We ſeldome read of a promiſe thus backt: uſually God delivers his promiſes without ſuch a bottome as this: when God told <hi>Abraham</hi> he would be his God, and the God of his ſeed:<note place="margin">Gen. 17 7, 8.</note> he gives no ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there as this; he does not ſay for I know my thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee <hi>Abraham:</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not in all the Scripture the like inſtance, that God ſhould give a reaſon, and ſuch a reaſon as this, why he would viſit his people with love, with ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Certainly there is ſomewhat in it more then ordinary, it is not becauſe Gods bare word of promiſe is not ſufficient for the faith of his people: neither is it becauſe God would now che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or ſatisfie any curioſitie o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:152491:17"/>but God does this moſt freely and lovingly; tis his mercy to his people, that makes him give in this over-plus to his promiſe, and heaps up to them this great meaſure, good, preſſed down, and running over into their boſoms. The Lord does this,</p>

            <p>Secondly, theſe thoughts that God hath towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what are they, but the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall movings of Gods mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and for the good of his people? To clear them yet more what they be, conſider theſe five things touching theſe thoughts of God:</p>

            <p n="3">3. The fruits of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and purpoſes of God: theſe are his heavenly care, his holy plots, his bleſſed deviſes, his divine inventions: how, by what way and means to do his people good:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.7.</note> he careth for you (ſaies <hi>Peter</hi>) and with ſuch a care that is full and alſufficient, ſo that his children need not, muſt not take up ſome, and leave the reſt to him: but they muſt caſt all their care upon him:<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.16.</note> God gives peace to his people by all meanes, who is himſelf the Lord and Prince of peace.</p>

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="2">2. As there is a bleſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light going along with theſe thoughts of God towards his, ſo there is a moſt wiſe, ſetled, and firm conſtancy in theſe thoughts of God towards his people: he is of one mind (ſaies <hi>Job</hi>) who can turn him?

            <p n="2">2. To give his people reſt: the Spirit of the Lord cauſed Iſrael to reſt (ſaies the ſame Prophet in the ſame place) twas a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſt indeed which the Spirit of God cauſed: Iſrael was in many troubles, he went thorow many brakes, but at laſt the Spirit of God ſet him down, placed him, and planted him in that land of reſt All indeed was not over in a moment, Iſrael

Gods thought reſt not in pitching upon half mercies: tis Iſraels reſt his thoughts reach unto: and what God determined, he effected by a mighty hand, and when he ſaw his time, he gave Iſrael to ſit down, and enjoy that good Land of reſt, purpoſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed long before.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the declaration and manifeſtation of theſe thoughts of God in their viſible fruits: When Gods thoughts come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as it were, when they ſhine forth in the eye of the world, when Gods decree,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152491:31"/>bring forth, when that which lay in the womb of his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is born, there is a time, and a ſet time too, when the Lords decree brings forth (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> tels us;<note place="margin">Zeph. 2.2.</note> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon calls upon the people of God to gather themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſeek meekneſſe and righteouſneſſe, ere the decree brings forth, ere the day of the Lords anger come upon them: Theſe two the Prophet makes to be one, the comming of the day of Gods anger, and the bringing forth of the Decree: For, as ſoon as the decree of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice comes forth, the day of anger is broke, it appeares: ſo his purpoſes and thoughts of anger towards the wicked, makes anger at length to goe forth; theſe ſend forth his wrath in ſtrokes, terrible woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, deadly conſumings: Theſe thoughts of wrath, break forth in the face of God by frowns, in the hand of God by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152491:32"/>blowes. Moreover, this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his thoughts of juſtices holds proportion with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, is all out as full as his thoughts were: every blow he determins to ſtrike, hewil ſtrike, he wil not ſpare them a jot: <hi>The anger of the Lord</hi> (ſayes <hi>Jer.</hi>) <hi>ſhall not return till he hath executed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 23.20.</note> 
               <hi>and till he hath performed the thoughts of his heart.</hi> In theſe Divine purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, God doth, as it were, ſecretly bind himſelfe, promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to his own juſtice, ſo much ſatisfaction upon thoſe that provoke it, according as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: now <hi>God</hi> performing this to the full, and the anger of the Lord will not return till it hath executed thus far: he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver call back his anger from the purſuit of ſuch, untill it hath purſued them long enough, far enough. So his purpoſes of good towards his people, they bring forth as plentifully: look what our God promiſes to his own grace, to his own bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152491:32"/>that he will perform to the full: look what good he purpoſes concerning his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that, to a grain, they ſhall have from his gracious hand: he works freely in a way of mercy, till he hath performed the thoughts of his heart, that is, all his thoughts towards them, till there be a thought of God towards them, but beares his fruit, and brings it forth to them, and for them, till it be ſeen that there is not a thought of God barren towards them: never ſhall the purpoſes and thoughts of God return, till all this bee done. The thoughts of God are like <hi>Solomons</hi> Flock of Sheep,<note place="margin">Sol. Song 4.2.</note> every one bears twins, and none is barren among them: Our God who hates barren thoughts in his people, will not, cannot have them in his own heart: his purpoſes will all out in their time, and his hand will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he hath pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152491:33"/>in his own thoughts: if his thoughts be for deliverance of his people, delivered they ſhall be, what ever oppoſes, theſe purpoſes of God will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it away, theſe will beare all down before them, and make a plain way even amongſt mountains, for their due and glorious performance.</p>
            <p>The ſecond term to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, is to have the next place, and it is this, [The thoughts I think towards you] wherein this queſtion muſt be reſolved, How and why the thoughts of God are ſaid to be towards his people.

            <p>Secondly, ſee here the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of his love: This is to be noted, the wombe of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:152491:50"/>to gifts, and moſt rich ones too. all that enjoy theſe, are made by theſe, as a royall Diadem and a Crowne of glory in the hand of their God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the freeneſſe of theſe thoughts of God is here noted: God thinkes to give, where he ſees no good, before hee gives, to thoſe he thinkes to give, in whom hee ſees no deſervings, and from whom he might have withheld his mercy without wrong to them, had his will and pleaſure beene ſo: God, where he bleſſes, hee bleſſes by giving: whom he rewards, hee rewards by giving: the ſoule that is made gracious, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, that is patient,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.29</note> it is given to him, he hath it this way, and no way elſe: a ſoule that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded tis by way of gift:<note place="margin">Revel. 22.12.</note> 
               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my reward is with me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to give to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his worke,</hi> ſhall bee: when mercy rewards and ſaves, it is a gift: and when Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152491:51"/>and damnes, tis a gift of juſtice, or of debt that is due to evill workers, and that God dos freely, of his owne minde.</p>
            <p>For the fourth thing: they are thoughts to give an end, and expectation: ſatisfying thoughts: you ſhall have (ſaies God) what mercy you do, will, or can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: God meanes this:</p>
            <p n="1">1 That they ſhould have an end put to all their miſeries: the dark cloud ſhould be blown over: their ſufferings ſhould have a bleſſed end, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would put a full period to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Such an end, an end ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that it ſhould anſwer their living and large expectations:<note place="margin">Iam. 5.11.</note> that it ſhould ſatisfy all their longings: ſuch an end as bleſſed, JOB had in his afflictions: the end of the Lord was gracious to him: the Lord did ſhew even in him, and by him, that he was very pitifull, and of tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: ſo as the Lord might well
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152491:51"/>inſtance in JOB, for to prove what tender bowels he had: he might well ſay to his children, go to JOB and ſee whether I am not gracious and of tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: JOBS example may learne us both the graciouſneſſe, that God ſhewes, &amp; the patience that Saints ſhould ſhew. JOB had an end, and expectation too, ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious was God to him, and ſo good will God be to his people now: I can ſhew the like againe (ſaies God) I can do as much for you, and ſo I purpoſe, my thought are for to walke in the ſame way of mercy towards you: you ſhall have as much as an ende and expectation will come too (that is as good an end as you can wiſh, deſire, or long for) novv to make the mercy thus compleat, there muſt be in it theſe in gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there muſt be a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bringing them backe from their Captivity, and an happie
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152491:52"/>deliverance of them from all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions:<note place="margin">Ier. 30.10</note> God muſt ſave his Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael from afar, and his ſeed from the land of their captivity: <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> muſt returne, be in reſt, and be quiet, and none make him afraid.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A full performance of all the promiſes of the Lord to them: God muſt give them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſes, or elſe he could not give occording to their expectations.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A bleſſed giving in of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces, with ſpirituall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements for grace received, for the abounding of thanks gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to wards God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The ſhining of Gods face upon them againe, which brings with it ſweet and ſpirituall peace: This the faithfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p n="5">5 All this muſt be done ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, in the beſt, in the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time: when they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy when the full worke of God was done upon their hearts, when their expectations and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152491:52"/>wantings were at higheſt;<note place="margin">Zech. 9.1.</note> when they look moſt; when their eyes were moſt intentively pitcht upon God: When comes the burden upon-<hi>Hadrach,</hi> and the reſts, upon Damaſcus, that is upon the cruell enemies of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and the inflicters of all their miſeries? but then, when the eyes of all Iſrael are as one man towards the Lord: and then comes all other mercies too that they needed, even a full ſupply from the Lord their God.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond thing, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to proove the truth now in hand: wee may reaſon thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe God is Love, and this is much more then to ſay (God loves,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 4.8, 16.</note> it notes thus much that it is the very Eſſence and nature of God: Man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to love, but cannot be ſaid to be love: God is ſo, tis affirmed from his own mouth: when this was ſaid, twas a piece of Gods own minde, and tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:152491:53"/>twice in one chapter, twas a ſweet argument it ſeems, the Apoſtle was now upon: he is incouraging Saints to love, and love ſo, as to dwell in it, and therefore he mentions this, <hi>that God is love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16. Rom. 5.8.</note> if they would looke ſo high (as tis moſt fit they ſhould) they might eaſily ſee a moſt glorious pattere of love, that they could never reach and that was love it ſelfe: wee read of Gods ſo loving the world, &amp;c. And of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his love to us: but we read not (as I remember) of this phraſe, that God is love, but in this place: Now the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt (having not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard him, and ſeen him, and taſted him, but enjoyed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of glorious fellowſhip with him, wherein by moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſweet experience, they had been ſo oft, ſo much ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with this River of his good pleaſure) they come up to the higheſt expreſſion that can bee
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:152491:53"/>to ſet out the love of God, when they ſay, God is love: ſurely thoſe glorious Saints in heaven, that are at the Wel-head of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe (as it were) and enjoy the fulneſſe of love in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, could not have ſpoken more gloriouſly of this love, then to ſay, God is love: now if hee be ſo; God will, Firſt, be pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his: Secondly, hee will bee contriving for his, and Thirdly, he will be overlooking all the unworthineſſe of his.</p>
            <p n="1">1 He will be full of pity: as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pities, ſo the Lord will (ſaies <hi>David</hi>) Gods bowels could not but be troubled for his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31.20.</note> and ſo troubled too, that God takes up this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that he will ſurely have mercy upon him: God could quickly finde bowels, when <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> found his ſins, and his mercy ſayes now, <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> is a deere ſon, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is a pleaſant childe all is forgot alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> hath done his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152491:54"/>former Idolatrie, his former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenes, his former ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, it is all covered all drowned already in the ſea of his mercy: here behold bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion indeed: here is pity that is infinitly tender: ſhining in the very carriage and language of God towards poore creatures full of ſinns, and full of troubles, both at once: this is the very way of Gods bowels, let his children be in danger, in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, under ſorrowes and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the heart of God cannot reſt, it will bubble, it will be hot, it will boyle up twill run over to his afflicted children.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This love that is God it ſelfe, Gods owne nature, twill be a contriving: thoughts of love will flow from it: God is all act <hi>(purus actus)</hi> and ſo is this love, it is buſie, hard at worke, plotting for, and pitching upon, ſome great good for thoſe whom he delights to chooſe, to love, to honour: I will ſurely have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152491:54"/>(ſayes God) I will ſurely do ſuch a poore ſovle good: his ſould ſhall bleſſe me: his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall enjoy me: his ſpirit ſhall rejoyce in me: his heart ſhalbe fild with my peac, with my comforts, with my bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This love of God can tell how to overlook all the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of his people: God ſtands not upon the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures worthineſſe: I will have mercy, upon whom I will have mercy, this is the voice of Gods bowels: to love freely, this is his way:<note place="margin">Rom. 9.15 It was ſpoken to MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES, yet it was all Goſpell.</note> he will therefore think thoughts of good, becauſe hee is good, not becauſe the creature is good: if God beare good will to a poore ſoule, he will ſhew it, though it be to a raging, to a perſecuting <hi>Saul;</hi> whiles he is a killing, God is a ſaving, whilſt he is making ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocke of the church, God is bringing him in: Who more prophane then the Prodigall? who waſted mercies more baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152491:55"/>then he? And yet the Love of the Father can call in ſuch a whretch, can embrace him in his returne, can powre out it ſelfe moſt ſweetly into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, Give him the title of this my Sonne,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.24.</note> and he hath all the welcome home, that mercy it ſelfe can make for him. Who more Idolatrous then <hi>Ephraim?</hi> he was joyned to Idols (ſo God teſtifies) his caſe was deſperate: let him alone ſayes God: Yet the Love of God darts upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praims</hi> heart, and then hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes himſelfe, then he prayes, <hi>Turne me, thou art the Lord my God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.17.</note> then he repents and ſmites upon his thigh for very ſhame and indignation: and what does God now when hee ſees and heares thus,<note place="margin">Ier. 31.18.</note> of the worke of grace upon <hi>Ephraims</hi> heart? Why, the next newes we here is this, Ephraim is called a deare ſon, and a pleaſant childe: who more unworthy: and yet who wore gladly received, who
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152491:55"/>more ſurely bleſt, then <hi>Ephraim</hi> was?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Lord by theſe thoughts of his dos ſo ſet up his owne name: tis no leſſe then infinite glory that ſhines forth, and redounds to God by theſe purpoſes of his.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 33.1, 2, 3.</note> when he carges the righteous to rejoyce in the Lord, and to praiſe him, marke upon what grounds and why he would have this duty done: he gives three ſpeciall reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The word of the Lord is right,<note place="margin">4. v.</note> therefore rejoyce in him and bleſſe him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The workes of the Lord they are ſuch, ſo great, and all done in truth: therefore bleſſe him.<note place="margin">11. v.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 The counſell of the Lord ſtands for ever: the thoughts of his heart to all generations:<note place="margin">10. v.</note> He that brings the counſell of the Heathen to nought, that makes the devices of the people (hee meanes that are againſt him, his

               <hi>How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God: How great is the ſum of them?</hi> Theſe were exceeding honourable in his eyes: theſe took up his minde: theſe drew his heart even up to as high as admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and well they might, for what dos God himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to man, ſo much as his love, and what are theſe thoughts, but thoughts of love?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe the Saint ſtand in ſuch need of theſe thoughts of love towards them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Elſe they ſhould have no
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152491:56"/>mercy to ſave or comfort them: where there is no conception there can bee no birth looked for: God thinkes firſt, and workes afterwards: hee never gave any mercy to his, but he thought them that mercy firſt: What God does to, and for his,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.90.</note> tis according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his goodneſſe which hee purpoſed in himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Elſe what bottome would there bee for the Saints com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts? How could they read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand (ſo as they do) how gracious God will be to them, if there were no promiſes made? And where would promiſes of good bee from God, if there were not purpoſes of good in God firſt? What are the Lords promiſes, but his ſpeaking thoughts of love, his proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that grace, which is in the breaſt and heart of God to poor beleevers? Now if no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, no props of faith, no grounds of incouragement, no
